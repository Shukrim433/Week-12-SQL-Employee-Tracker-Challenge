/*????????
The parameter "department" would typically be passed to the addDepartment method from the code that calls it. 
This code would likely be part of your application logic and would use the addDepartment method to insert a new 
department into the database based on user input or other requirements. 

 the parameter "department" likely refers to an object containing information about the department to be added 
 to the database. This object may include properties such as "department_name" to specify the name of the department.*/
